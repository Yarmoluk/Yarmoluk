**41 domain knowledge systems deployed across 27 verticals in 38 days.** One person. One methodology. Knowledge graphs in, MCP-ready systems out.

## The Thesis

A single architecture — decompose any domain into structured concept graphs, map dependencies, deploy — works regardless of field. Oral surgery, cybersecurity, equipment finance, peptide science, IP law, industrial IoT. The methodology is domain-agnostic. The evidence is below.
