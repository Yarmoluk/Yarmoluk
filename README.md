Building intelligent knowledge systems across diverse domains using structured knowledge graphs and AI.

## What I'm Working On

I'm exploring whether a single methodology — structuring domain expertise as knowledge graphs and deploying AI to reason over them — works across radically different fields. So far, it does.

### Intelligent Textbooks

Each project starts with a ~200-concept knowledge graph, generates structured chapters respecting prerequisite dependencies, and deploys as an interactive MkDocs Material site with learning graph visualizations.

| Project | Domain | Concepts | Chapters | Live Site |
|---------|--------|----------|----------|-----------|
| [TankScan Course](https://github.com/Yarmoluk/tankscan-course) | Industrial IoT & Wireless Tank Monitoring | 90+ | 15 | [View](https://yarmoluk.github.io/tankscan-course/) |
| [Digital Transformation with AI](https://github.com/Yarmoluk/Digital-Transformation-with-AI-Spring-2026) | SEIS 666 Course Text | 200 | 11 | [View](https://yarmoluk.github.io/Digital-Transformation-with-AI-Spring-2026/) |
| [Black Hills IP](https://github.com/Yarmoluk/blackhillsip) | IP Management & Legal Technology | 200 | 13 | [View](https://yarmoluk.github.io/blackhillsip/) |
| [Modern OMS](https://github.com/Yarmoluk/maxfac-course) | Oral & Maxillofacial Surgery | 270 | 20 | [View](https://yarmoluk.github.io/maxfac-course/) |
| [Ink Sanctum](https://github.com/Yarmoluk/ink-sanctum-textbook) | Tattoo Aftercare & Preparation | 200 | 12 | [View](https://yarmoluk.github.io/ink-sanctum-textbook/) |
| [Proto Hologram](https://github.com/Yarmoluk/proto-hologram-textbook) | Holographic Sales Enablement | 24 | 16 | [View](https://yarmoluk.github.io/proto-hologram-textbook/) |

### AI-Powered Tools

| Project | What It Does |
|---------|-------------|
| [MacroCoach AI](https://github.com/Yarmoluk/macro-coach) | Shareable AI nutrition coach with adaptive macro tracking and meal planning |
| [IP Paralegal Bot](https://github.com/Yarmoluk/ip-paralegal-knowledge-bot) | Decision support bot reasoning over the Black Hills IP knowledge graph |

### The Pattern

Every domain follows the same pipeline:

```
Course Description → Learning Graph (~200 concepts) → Chapter Structure →
Content Generation → Interactive MicroSims → Glossary → FAQ → Quizzes →
AI Chatbot → Deploy
```

The knowledge graph is the brain. Everything else — chapters, chatbots, quizzes, glossaries — is a different view of the same structured expertise.

## Currently

- Teaching **SEIS 666: Digital Transformation with AI** at University of St. Thomas (Spring 2026)
- Learning from [Dan McCreary's](https://github.com/dmccreary) intelligent textbook methodology
- Building with **Claude Code** and the [claude-skills](https://github.com/dmccreary/claude-skills) framework
